### **About Myself**:
I currently have two professions, and neither of them are related to web technologies.

I have an inquisitive nature, which led me to study programming. Currently, I am learning a new profession as a web developer on my own.
My diligence and attentiveness helps me to learn.

In the chosen field, the prospect of remote work and constant movement forward, together with developing technologies, attracts.
So, I have a goal and a crazy motivation, so I will not stop until I get a job in a field that is still new to me.
